## Specifications

This game has been made under GNU/Linux and has been tested with GCC version 6.3.1.
We don't know if this project works under Windows NT or Darwin based systems.

There's a lot of things we can do differently, but it's just a school project
so we won't fix or refactor the code of this repository
